Hi there, I'm Tomás. I am a Software and Computer Engineering student (EIA University) focusing on Data Engineering, Data Science, and AI Engineering. I specialize in transforming data into value: ingestion → exploration → preparation/transformation → analysis/modeling. I have developed ETL/ELT pipelines, dimensional modeling, and feature engineering flows to train and evaluate ML models. I have also implemented RAG agents that combine retrieval in vector databases with response generation. I work daily with Python, SQL, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and PostgreSQL. I am currently delving deeper into data engineering, data science, and generative artificial intelligence.
