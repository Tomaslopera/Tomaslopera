### Hi There ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tomas

I'm a systems engineering student at Universidad EIA, currently in 7th semester. My focus as a programmer is on backend development and data science, and I'm passionate about building robust and scalable systems. Here's a bit about my tech stack:

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Java
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, React
- **Databases**: MySQL, SQLServer and PostgreSQL. Firebase Database to storage some images.
- **Web Engineering**: I've been working on developing RESTful APIs and have experience using FastAPI. I've used NGROK to deploy APIs and Netlify to deploy web pages.
- **Integration**: I know how to connect Python with React, utilizing APIs. I've learned to verify the endpoints using tools like Postman.
- **Data Engineering**: Experience in python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy.
- **Agile**: Scrum experience using jira, management of epics and user stories.

#### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
I'm always eager to learn and expand my skill set. Currently, I'm exploring more about:

- **Data Engineering:** Continuously improving my knowledge in python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, ...
- **Web Services:** Exploring cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) to understand their capabilities in building scalable applications while using S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda, ...
- **Databases:** Improving my skills using Datasets from Kaggle and learning Non Relational Databases.
