### Hi There ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tomas

I'm a systems engineering student at Universidad EIA, currently in 5th semester. My focus as a programmer is on backend development and data science, and I'm passionate about building robust and scalable systems. Here's a bit about my tech stack:

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Java, React
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI
- **Databases**: MySQL, SQLServer and PostgreSQL
- **Web Services**: I've been working on developing RESTful APIs and have experience using FastAPI. I know how to work with Firebase Database to storage some images.
- **Integration**: I know how to connect Python with React, utilizing APIs. I've learned to verify these connections using tools like Postman.

#### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
I'm always eager to learn and expand my skill set. Currently, I'm exploring more about:

- **Data Science and Machine Learning:** Exploring python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...
- **Web Services:** Exploring cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) to understand their capabilities in building scalable applications.
- **Databases:** Improving my skills using AdventureWorks.
