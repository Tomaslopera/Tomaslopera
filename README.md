Hi there, I'm Tom√°s. I am a Systems and Computer Engineering student at EIA University, expecting to graduate in 2026-2. My main focus is Data Engineering, Data Science, and AI. I am specializing in transforming data into value through ingestion, exploration, preparation/transformation, and analysis/modeling processes. I have developed ETL/ELT processes, dimensional modeling, and feature engineering flows to train and evaluate ML models. I have also implemented RAG agents that combine retrieval in vector databases with response generation. I am currently delving deeper into data engineering, data science, and generative AI.
